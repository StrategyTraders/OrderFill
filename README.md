# How-To

2: Add the code in include.txt at the end of your AFL strategy/trading system  

3: Confirm if buy price is same as your strategy with testrun.exe

4: Use SendOrder.exe instead of TestRun.exe for live trading

5: Run the program and see if the order box is being filled as per your preference. (make sure run as admin/etc is on)


# Bugs 

this script is tested in a limited environment and the possibility of errors/bugs could be present.
